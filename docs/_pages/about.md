Hi, my name is Sean and I'm a freshman at UW. Although I was born in Korea, I've lived in Washington for over 17 years.

I'm usually interested in a lot of things and my interests tend to change a lot, but currently I enjoy:

* Kendo
	* UW Kendo Club member
* Coding
	* Mainly studying Java in school but also familiar with Python syntax
	* Interested in NLP and machine learning.
* Asian Literature
	* Currently interested in Japanese lit
* Asian Languages
	* (mostly) fluent in Korean, know some Japanese and very basic Mandarin
* Psychology
	* Always been interested in personality psychology
	* I dropped MBTI and Socionics, mostly use Big 5 now
	(But MBTI is still fun to talk about)
* Writing
	* Occasionally write poetry and stories (sometimes for D&D!)
	* These days focus on reflective writing
* Music
	* I've learned piano and violin in the past
	* Currently trying to teach myself guitar
	(but I don't have a guitar with me right now)

## This Site
I created this site as a personal blog as well as to experiment with static websites. Currently, it's just a space for my blogposts but I'm trying to find a way to add other things.
