Hi, my name is Sean and I'm a freshman at UW. Although I was born in Korea, I've lived in Washington for over 17 years and can be considered 'Korean-American' (although I don't particularly like that label).

I'm usually interested in a lot of things and my interests tend to change a lot, but currently I enjoy:

* Kendo
	* UW Kendo Club
* Coding
	* Mainly studying Java in school 
	* Am familiar with Python syntax
	* Trying to learn HTML, Javascript, and CSS
* Asian Literature
	* Currently interested in Japanese lit
* Asian Languages
	* (mostly) fluent in Korean, know some Japanese and very basic Mandarin
* Psychology
	* Always been interested in personality psychology
	* I dropped MBTI and Socionics, mostly use Big 5 now
* Writing
	* Used to write more poetry
	* Trying to write more stories 
* Music
	* I've learned piano and violin in the past
	* Currently trying to teach myself guitar
	(but I don't have a guitar with me anymore)

## This Site
I created this site as a personal blog as well as to experiment with static websites. Currently, it's just a space for my blogposts but I'm trying to find a way to host my other coding projects on the site. I'm thinking of learning Javascript so I can easily embed my code into the site.
